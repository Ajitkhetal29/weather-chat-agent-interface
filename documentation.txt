**Approach

Started with a basic chat UI (user input, send button, auto-scroll).

Integrated with Weather Agent API.

Added dark mode, message search, timestamps, and sound alerts.

Enhanced UX with delivery status (sending/sent/delivered) and chat export.


Known Limitations / Improvements

❌ Multiple conversation threads not implemented yet.

❌ Basic text formatting only (**bold** + newlines).

❌ No persistent storage (refresh clears chat).

🔜 Could improve error handling for failed API responses.
